# Unsplash React App

I made this project while learning react.js.
The renders are made with a card component and the data is fetched from the web site unsplashed.com. 
Some of the challenges I faced was to learn :
- how to host a static react app using Amazon Web Services (AWS);
- how to use an external API (unsplash api) in our app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The project is live at: [https://react-photo.mangoye.com/](https://react-photo.mangoye.com/)
## Summary

- Realisation: -- 
- Level: Beginer/intermediate
- Stack: Html, React.JS
- External API: Unsplash API
